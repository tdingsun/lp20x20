I became obsessed with Lin Shicheng’s pipa interpretations for the same reason I became obsessed with Vlado Perlemuter’s piano Chopin. Both players are so reserved, so tight-fisted, so stingy with their emotions… It turns this music, which lends itself to gag-inducing sentimentally, into really good stuff.
